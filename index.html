                            <p>
                                Developed 2 Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) and 1 AI-Modelled game prototypes. In the AI-Modelled game prototype, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were used to create 3D models. These AI-designed models were used to develop an <a href="https://notsailor.itch.io/game-modelled-by-ai" target="_blank">spaceship shooter game</a>.
                            </p>

                                BCI game prototypes are based on NextMind headset that reads brain signals and converts into interactions in digital applications. Two game prototypes were developed with this technology, a <a href="https://notsailor.itch.io/platformer-game-for-nextmind" target="_blank">puzzle-platform</a> and a <a href="https://notsailor.itch.io/tic-tac-toe-with-nextmind">Tic-Tac-Toe</a> game. These games were shared by the development team of the NextMind company in a blogpost <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/m%C3%BCcahit-gemici-a7b613180_as-i-mentioned-before-im-in-the-new-blog-activity-6856569816199831552--AO6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACrOMz8BzXyrPfYDi_BErTN2aLgzHs_I8pg" target="_blank">(Announcement)</a>.

                                I started working as a Game Developer. Worked on prototyping mobile games (development and 3D asset design), publishing processes on App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android), advertising the published games, maintaining the company website, and entering interviews for new developer applications. I also worked closely with game designers from <a href="https://www.moonee.io">Moonee</a> (mobile game publisher) and developed prototypes for the publisher tests. I stopped working there after 1 year to continue my education.

                                A vertical endless runner developed for Servo Studios. Reach the Space challenges players to pilot a customizable ship as high as possible, dodging aerial and extraterrestrial threats while collecting coins and power-ups.

                                For my second project at Servo Studios, I built upon the simplicity of my previous work but introduced a new reflex-based mechanic. Players must use precise timing to launch across and latch onto the opposite wall. The game features different styles of infinite towers and a fully customizable character, allowing players to mix and match various outfits and accessories.

                                For my third project at Servo Studios, I reimagined the mechanics of the hit game Subway Surfers within an aerial combat setting. Sky Surfer combines classic lane-based dodging with arcade shooter gameplay, challenging players to navigate tight city corridors while blasting through waves of enemy planes.

                                Garbage Vacuumer is a successful hyper-casual title that has achieved over 10,000 downloads. I originally designed the core concept and gameplay, then collaborated with designers from the publisher Moonee to refine and polish the experience. Players are tasked with cleaning up clutter-filled cities, starting with a handheld vacuum and progressing to heavy machinery like trucks and helicopters. The game features a robust progression system where players manage resources to upgrade their Storage, Area, and Power to handle increasingly difficult debris.

                                Shoot & Cover was my final project at Servo Studios, co-developed with Moonee. While the publisher provided design assets, I handled the full technical implementation. The game achieved a highly competitive $0.31 CPI (Cost Per Install) during market tests. Based on these strong results, Servo Studios decided to self-publish the title rather than proceeding with a publisher deal. After successfully delivering this project, I departed the company to advance my academic career.
